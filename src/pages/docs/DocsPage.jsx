      <h3>What is CriptoGravity(CG)?</h3>
      <p>
        With CG's revolutionary building block system technology, people could
        build their own web3 applications only through simple page interaction.
        Therefore, any person and organization could have the same or even
        surpass the underlying technical capabilities of first-class projects
        and promote innovation in creation and gameplay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply put, CG provides a fast lane for the vigorous development of
        web3.
      </p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, we have seen high-profile creators transition
        to Web3 contexts to engage with their followers and to experiment with
        new forms of media creations.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Many excellent art creators often suffer from lack of coding
        ability or insufficient funds to hire technical teams to develop their
        own web3 applications and lack of related NFT marketing tools to empower
        their work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking into account the lack of technology and marketing methods,
        resulting in a large number of excellent creators unable to enter the
        era of web3, CG applications were born.
      </p>
      <p>
        CG give creators a way to achieve their vision — whether it’s to create
        the next viral NFT project, manage DAO organization, empower Gamefi and
        game characters, or personal web3 application construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, CG provides creators access to the tools and different
        playgames to support they need for their projects, from Dapp official
        website deployment to marketing warm-up and launch. Any creator can
        become a project Producer on the platform, who can
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Build your own project website and deploy domain name through simple
          page interaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Achieve one-stop smart contract deployment and setup without code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Upload integrate digital asset types such as NFT pictures, music, and
          videos, and store and host many different asset types.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose mainstream sale modes based on your preferences, such as
          pre-sale, whitelist system, blind box sale.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>
        CG aims to create a high-performance, scalable, and efficient smart
        contract integration framework application platform designed to overcome
        the limitations of the previous generation platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        CG’s mission is to create a web3 integrated framework application
        platform based on Ethereum, through which anyone can build web3
        applications at low cost and realize smart contract deployments such as
        content on-chain and brand official website deployment without code.
      </p>

      <h3>Token distribution plan</h3>
      <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
        <img className={styles['CG_charts_PIE']} src={CG_charts_PIE} alt="" />
      </div>
      <br />
      <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
        <img className={styles['CG_form_1']} src={CG_form_1} alt="" />
      </div>
      <br />
      <h3>Token utility</h3>
      <p>
        1. Project owners who own CG tokens can enjoy lower commissions and
        access to more advanced functional modules. The project party conducts a
        step-by-step commission based on the number of CG tokens held.
      </p>
      <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
        <img className={styles['CG_form_2']} src={CG_form_2} alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        2. Participate in community governance, such as gaining voting rights on
        major issues of CG community
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Participate in the platform project empowerment plan and a series of
        decisions on project quality, compliance, ecological development, etc.
      </p>
      <p>4. Get priority for minting NFT whitelist</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Individuals who hold platform tokens will be eligible to purchase from
          the whitelist of the project party on the platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          The project party can release a certain number of whitelists, and the
          whitelists will be randomly selected according to the number of
          tokens.
        </li>
        <li>
          The probability assigned to each interval is different. If there are a
          large number of people in a certain interval, the probability of
          obtaining an individual will decrease.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the range with a large allocation amount has not been minted, the
          remaining whitelist qualifications will be moved to a lower-order
          range in sequence.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
        <img className={styles['CG_form_3']} src={CG_form_3} alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>5.Token destruction</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We plan to use 5% of our future revenue to repurchase GRA in the
          market and burn it regularly to ensure token deflation.
        </li>
        <li>
          For high-quality projects, we will take out tokens from ecological
          development to provide financial support and commission reduction for
          the project party, and permanently lock these tokens with reduced
          commissions, which are not tradable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>6. Token payment</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the future, we will launch an "open platform" to meet the highly
          customized business model of developers' own projects. The cloud
          service capabilities in the open platform will be purchased and used
          by using GRA.
        </li>
